# SuperDraw

This was a university group project written by myself one other student in January 2018. It was submitted as part of the University of Liverpool Master's Degree in Web Science and Big Data. It was the first assignment in the module about Object Oriented Programming in Java. The assignment was a simple application handling different shapes and implemented using OOP techniques. 

Myself and the other student divided development tasks and both contributed equally to the final code. We choose to use GitHub for our source code repo in order to practice standard development techniques even though this was not strictly part of the University assignment.
